In crafting the oral antiseptic TFM at issue, FDA carefully considered the safety and effectiveness of CPC on several occasions and presented a clear path by which to expa
nd the parameters of the monograph. In 1982, the Advisory Review Panel on Over-the-Counter (OTC) Oral Cavity Drug Products (the Panel) issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking establishing the conditions under which OTC oral health care drug produc
t
s are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded.2 The Panel reviewed CPC as an OTC antimicrobial for topical use on the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. It noted that CPC is a quatenary nitrogenous compound derived from pyridi
ne. The Panel expressed concern that toxic doses of CPC exhibit systemic effects, such as an autonomic (nicotinic) blocking effect on the ganglia and a curariform (muscarinic) response.3 The Panel concluded that insufficient data existed on CPC\rquote 
s tumorigenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects in humans during long- term use, and therefore, it classified CPC in Category III for safety.4 
\par With respect to the effectiveness of CPC, the Panel again classified CPC in Category III. The Panel noted that \'93there are 
no data to justify the use of [CPC] in oral health care products on a continuing day-to-day basis for protracted periods of time for prophylaxis and other uses when no symptoms are present and no therapeutic benefit can be demonstrated.\'93
5 It concluded that proof of CPC\rquote s ability to kill or inhibit certain microorganisms found in the mouth is insufficient to demonstrate a therapeutic benefit in treatment of sore mouth or throat.\rquote

FDA examined CPC for use as an oral antiseptic and addressed the comments it had received in resp
onse to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. It noted the distinction between products recommended for long-term use, like mouthwash, and products intended for short-term use, and stated that safety concerns regarding the long-term use of oral antis
e
ptic ingredients were not necessarily relevant to the short-term use of these ingredients. FDA reviewed several CPC toxicity studies and adverse reaction files. It concluded that 0.025 to 0.1% CPC is safe as an OTC oral antiseptic when labeled for short-t
erm use (i.e., use is not to exceed seven days).12 However, FDA noted its continuing concern regarding CPC\rquote 
s potential toxicological effects discussed by the Oral Cavity Panel, especially in situations in which excessive gum irritation or bleeding exists, and recommended product labeling to warn consumers against use in such situations.

4 For example, in one study, the incubation conditions used to prepare the test cultures were unlike those recommended by the Pane
l. In another study, CPC alone was not tested, making it impossible to determine whether or not CPC was effective in reducing the bacterial population of the oral cavity. Other studies were based upon plaque reduction, which both the Panel and FDA agreed 
was not an appropriate criterion for determining the effectiveness of oral antiseptics. Finally, FDA noted that it was \'93

cilia and mucosa may be different than its effect on oral cavity tissues. The Subcommittee limited its review of CPC to mouthrinse products, during the use of which CPC is in limited contact with the oral mucosa and the product is to be expelled after bri

s effect on the oral mucosa and associated structures does not establish its effect on the nasal cilia and mucosa because of the physiological differences between the two structures.
